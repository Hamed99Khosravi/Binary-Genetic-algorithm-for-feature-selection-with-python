# Binary-Genetic-algorithm-for-feature-selection-with-python
Feature selection in datasets can considerably improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by reducing the learning model creation time and increasing the accuracy of the learning process.
The volume of data with high features are increasing in many different fields creating many problems in using machine learning algorithms for analyzing these datasets. Some of the problems that can be mentioned are over-fitting, increased computational time, reduced accuracy, etc.
One of the most advanced algorithms for feature selection is the genetic algorithm.

Here you can use the code for binary genetic algorithm in python .
The explanation is provided ,too . Furthermore, you are offered to realize whether the feature selection has helped you .
You can compare the AIC(the formula is provided in the code) of your certain model with and without feature selection.
